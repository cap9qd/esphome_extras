# esphome_extras
Extra components for my esphome projects

They can be included to a esphome (version 1.18 or better) yaml file with the following command:

```
external_components:
  - source: github://middelink/esphome_extras@apds9301
  - source: github://middelink/esphome_extras@max72xx
  - source: github://middelink/esphome_extras@mcp9808
```

You don't need to load all of them, of course.
